name: ovnfs
description: Isolated copy-on-write checkouts of any folder or git repository with the ovnfs CLI. Use when you need a second copy of a folder, for example a risky experiment, another branch or commit, checking a patch against a clean HEAD, reviewing a PR beside the user's work, or one workspace per parallel agent. Use it instead of `git worktree add`, `git clone` or `cp -r`. Covers `ovnfs new`, `run`, `diff`, `apply`, `snap`, `fork`, `rm`, daemon-side `grep`/`glob`, and path classes and rules.

## In this repository (Mailstream): read first

This file is upstream's skill, vendored from
https://github.com/stencil-hq/ovnfs/blob/ef1dea8f06242ff9fa066e7db1ab530ee64dcb06/skills/ovnfs/SKILL.md
(v0.5.2, 2026-11-13); everything from `# ovnfs` on is its text unchanged. The installed ovnfs is
v0.5.2 on the Mac (MS-321) and Linux (MS-323); `ovnfs update` then `ovnfs restart` upgrades it.
A restart while a process has its working folder in a checkout (a build) can't unmount: v0.4.0
then keeps running, v0.5 forces the unmount on a second `stop`; either way open checkouts vanish
until the new daemon is up, so restart when no agent works in one.

- Open your checkout with `python3 ~/projects/mailstream/scripts/checkout.py NAME`, from any
  folder. It runs plain `ovnfs new` on the default checkout `~/projects/mailstream`, checks that
  the repo's rules took effect, makes the checkout jj workspace NAME of the default checkout's
  repository, runs `jj git fetch` and `jj new main` there and prints the path. Don't open one
  with `ovnfs new` yourself, and never with `--rev`.
- ovnfs v0.5 makes a checkout of a jj repository a jj workspace itself
  (https://github.com/stencil-hq/ovnfs/issues/37), through `jj workspace add --no-colocate`:
  Linux's jj (0.47.1) has it, the Mac's (0.45.1) doesn't, and there `ovnfs new` warns "is no jj
  workspace" and opens the checkout without one. `checkout.py` then adds the workspace itself, in
  an empty temporary folder (jj adds one only in an empty folder), and moves its `.jj` into the
  checkout (MS-179; its header has the details). Every checkout then shares one jj
  repository: commits, bookmarks, working copies and the operation log show in all of them at
  once (AGENTS.md, Version control, for the rules that follow). The checkout's `.git` is ovnfs's
  private git directory as captured; it goes stale, so use jj there, not git.
- The repo's `.o2/ovnfs.yml` hides every `target/` from ovnfs and makes `.turso/` `source`: a
  checkout keeps the default checkout's `.turso` as it was when it opened (APFS clones, no extra
  disk), and later builds or deletes there don't reach it (MS-152). ovnfs v0.3.0 ignores that in
  `--rev` checkouts: their ignored files stay live, whatever the rules say. The same file hides
  the default checkout's `.jj` from the capture; `checkout.py` puts the workspace's own there.
- The cargo workspace's `target` is outside the mount on every machine (MS-201, MS-279, MS-320):
  `checkout.py` makes the checkout's `target` a symlink to
  `~/.cache/mailstream-checkouts/NAME/target`, a copy-on-write clone (APFS on the Mac, reflink on
  Linux; seconds, no extra disk) of the default checkout's warm build taken as the checkout opens,
  so cargo can't take artifacts built from other source for the checkout's own; `checkout.py rm`
  deletes it. On Linux, ovnfs's FUSE mount handed a process that lists a folder the sizes its
  files had when the folder was opened, so a file written meanwhile read as empty for a second
  (https://github.com/stencil-hq/ovnfs/issues/48) and cargo builds in the mount failed. On the
  Mac, the warm build's ~50,000 files as `source` made up most of every capture and grew the
  daemon to 6-9 GB of memory. v0.5.2 fixed the FUSE bug (MS-323), and the target stays outside
  anyway: in the mount a build starts cold, goes through FUSE and grows the daemon (one cold
  engine test build took it to ~740 MB). Other build output (Flutter's `build/`, Swift's
  `.build`) stays in the mount.
- The default checkout stays clean on `main` (it is locked; only `scripts/warm-build.py` moves
  it), so a checkout of it starts at `main` as of the last warm build, and `jj new main` takes it
  to `origin`'s tip. The first release `scripts/ffi.py` in a new checkout rebuilds only the repo's
  2 crates (~30 s) on that warm build. `warm-build.py` always moves the default checkout to
  `main`, but builds nothing while a checkout of it that isn't frozen this way is open.
- Work leaves a checkout through jj (commit to `ms-<n>`, `scripts/land.py`; AGENTS.md, Version
  control), not `ovnfs apply`. Don't use `ovnfs diff`, `snap` or `fork` here: they count the build
  folders as source, so `diff` lists build output and a snapshot hashes gigabytes of it.
- Remove your checkout with `python3 ~/projects/mailstream/scripts/checkout.py rm NAME` once your
  part is done (landed and handed over): it forgets the jj workspace, then runs `ovnfs rm NAME`
  (plain `ovnfs rm` would leave `NAME@` in every `jj log`). A woken agent opens a fresh one. Never
  remove a checkout you didn't open, and never `prune`.
- Free disk by deleting your own checkout's build output or removing the checkout, never the
  default checkout's build folders. Nothing builds Swift in the default checkout, so a checkout's
  `.build` is its own. Don't share one `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` between checkouts: cargo locks it for one
  build at a time, and each checkout's source rebuilds the repo's crates over the others'.

# ovnfs

An ovnfs checkout is a copy-on-write view of a folder, served from one mount
(`~/checkouts/<name>` on macOS and Linux, drive `O:` on Windows). Opening one
takes about a second at any size and copies nothing. Writes stay in the
checkout, and the folder is written only when you `apply`. In a git repository
the checkout gets a private git directory, so commits made inside it stay
there. In a jj repository it is also a jj workspace of that repository, named
after the checkout: use `jj` inside it directly, never `jj git init`.

When you need a second copy of a folder, open an ovnfs checkout instead of
`git worktree add`, `git clone` or `cp -r`, unless the user asks for one of
those.

## Core loop

```sh
cd ~/src/app
cd "$(ovnfs new --name fix-auth)"   # stdout is only the path; the summary goes to stderr
# ...edit, build, test, commit freely...
ovnfs diff fix-auth -p              # source changes since the checkout opened
ovnfs apply fix-auth --dry-run      # preview the merge into ~/src/app
ovnfs apply fix-auth                # merge the changes into ~/src/app as uncommitted edits
ovnfs rm fix-auth                   # remove the checkout and unused snapshots
```

- Names: lowercase `[a-z0-9][a-z0-9._-]*`, up to 64 characters. Without
  `--name`, the checkout is named after the folder (`app`, then `app-2`, ...).
- `ovnfs ls` lists checkouts and snapshots of removed checkouts (TOUCHED is
  the last write through a checkout or to its git state); `ovnfs ls .` lists
  only checkouts of the current folder (a folder needs `.`, `..` or a slash);
  `ovnfs ls NAME` lists one checkout's snapshots.
- `ovnfs prune [DIR] [--idle 7d] [--no-diff] [--dry-run]` removes the
  checkouts matching every criterion given; `ovnfs ls` takes the same flags
  to preview. `rm` and `prune` remove unused snapshots; add
  `--sticky-snapshots` to keep them.
- Any verb starts the daemon if it isn't running. `ovnfs status` and
  `ovnfs stop` manage it, and `ovnfs restart` replaces it with one from the
  current binary without unmounting (NFS, SMB), so shells inside checkouts
  carry on; its log is `serve.log` in the state directory.

## Choosing what the checkout starts from

| Want | Command |
| --- | --- |
| The folder as it is now (uncommitted edits, untracked files, `node_modules`, build dirs) | `ovnfs new` |
| A commit or branch, without the folder's in-flight edits (e.g. to check your patch) | `ovnfs new --rev REV` |
| Only what is staged, without unstaged edits | `ovnfs new --rev HEAD --take :` |
| Old code with one path from another revision (e.g. a PR's test) | `ovnfs new --rev BASE --take pr-head:path/to/test` |
| An earlier snapshot | `ovnfs new --from SNAP` |

- `--rev` with a branch name attaches HEAD to that branch; a commit, tag or
  `HEAD` detaches it. Ignored files and build dirs stay available, so you
  don't need to reinstall dependencies.
- `--take SRC:PATH` can be repeated, and later ones win. SRC is `.` for the
  folder's working tree, empty for the index, or a revision. An empty PATH
  means the whole tree. Taken content becomes part of the base, so `diff` and
  `apply` never treat it as your change.
- `--rev` and `--take` cannot be combined with `--from`.

## Disposable runs

```sh
ovnfs run -- make test                 # open, run, remove; keeps the command's output and exit status
ovnfs run --rev HEAD -- go test ./...  # check the clean commit without touching the folder
ovnfs run --keep -- ./migrate.sh       # keep the checkout; its name and path go to stderr
```

The command runs in the checkout's subdirectory that matches your current
directory, with `OVNFS_CHECKOUT` set. The checkout is removed even when the
command fails or is interrupted.

## Bringing work back

- `ovnfs apply NAME` temporarily snapshots the checkout, then three-way merges
  each changed source path into the folder against the checkout's base. Commits are
  flattened: their changes land as uncommitted edits, and new files arrive
  untracked. Paths the user didn't touch take the checkout's version. Text
  files changed on both sides are merged as `git merge-file` would.
- On overlapping edits, apply writes git-style conflict markers
  (`<<<<<<< folder` … `>>>>>>> checkout NAME`) and exits 1. Resolve the
  markers in the folder, then run `ovnfs apply NAME` again; it refuses the file
  until the markers are gone. A deletion against an edit, or binary or symlink
  changes on both sides, is reported and the file is left untouched.
- Applying twice is a no-op, so you can keep working in the checkout and apply
  again later.
- `ovnfs apply NAME --branch B` turns the checkout's **commits** (not its
  uncommitted edits) into branch `B` in the folder's repository; the folder's
  files stay untouched. If `B` is checked out in the folder, apply
  fast-forwards it and updates only the changed index entries. A
  non-fast-forward, or staged changes on those paths, is refused; use another
  branch name.

## Snapshots, forks and rollback

```sh
ovnfs snap fix-auth -m before-refactor   # freeze the current state in O(1); --wait blocks until hashed
ovnfs fork fix-auth --name fix-auth-alt  # snapshot, then open a second checkout that diverges from it
ovnfs new --from s7 --name retry         # roll back = open a new checkout from a snapshot
ovnfs diff fix-auth s7                   # changes since a snapshot
ovnfs drop s7                            # release a snapshot
```

Snapshot IDs (`s7`) come from `ovnfs ls NAME`. Nothing rewrites a live
checkout or folder in place.

## Searching a checkout

`ovnfs grep` and `ovnfs glob` run inside the daemon and read the checkout
directly, without walking NFS/FUSE/SMB. On large trees, prefer them over
`rg`/`find` through the mount.

```sh
ovnfs grep 'func\s+New' fix-auth --glob '*.go' -C 2
ovnfs grep needle fix-auth --path src --mode filesWithMatches
ovnfs glob '*_test.go' fix-auth --limit 100
ovnfs --json glob '*.go' fix-auth --mtime  # newest first, with metadata
```

The target can be a checkout name, its mounted path, a directory below that
path, or any folder (defaults to `.`). Ignore files are honored, and `.git`
is always pruned.

## What a checkout contains: path classes

| Class | In the checkout | Seen by `diff`/`apply`/snapshots |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `source` | as captured at open | yes |
| `cache` (ignored dirs, `node_modules`, `.venv`, ...) | the live folder until the checkout writes there; writes go to the checkout only | no |
| `local` (ignored files, secrets, files over 100 MB) | the live folder until the checkout writes there; writes go to the checkout only | no |
| `hidden` (`.DS_Store`, ...) | absent | no |

- Build outputs and dependency installs inside a checkout never reach the
  folder, and `apply` never carries them back. To keep a generated file, make
  it `source`. A checkout that built or installed keeps its own copy of every
  path it wrote or deleted, so it no longer sees the folder's later builds or
  installs there.
- Files the user adds to the folder after you open the checkout do not
  appear in it. Open a new checkout to see them.
- `ovnfs explain PATH` names the rule that decided a path's class, with its
  file and line.
- Override classes per folder in `.o2/ovnfs.yml` at the source root, per user
  in `~/.o2/ovnfs.yml`, or per checkout with `--rule 'CLASS PREDICATE'`. The
  first matching rule wins:

  ```yaml
  rules: |
    source  .env.local   # carry one ignored file
    local   data/**      # keep a dataset out of snapshots
  ```

  `ovnfs config set --append rules 'source .env.local'` adds a rule line to
  the folder's file without editing YAML (`--global` for the user's);
  `ovnfs config list` shows both files' settings.

## Scripting and multiple agents

- Give each agent or job a unique name, such as a role prefix plus a random
  suffix (`agent-auth-3f9c1a`). Opening an existing name with `--name` fails
  with `exists: checkout NAME already exists`. Never `rm` a checkout you
  didn't open, nor `prune` unless the user asks, because that deletes
  another run's work.
- `rm` on a missing checkout fails with `not_found`; treat that as already
  removed. Record the names you open so a crashed run can still clean up.
- `--json` (before the verb or among its arguments) prints the raw reply. For
  example, `ovnfs --json new` returns `{"checkout":{"name","path","base","git",...},"capture":{...},"warnings":[]}`.
  `ovnfs start --json` makes sure the daemon runs and prints its admin socket,
  for embedding.
- Output is coloured on a terminal only: a captured or piped stream is plain
  text. `--color auto|always|never` overrides it. Parse `--json`, never the
  human tables, which pad and colour by terminal width.
- To tell whether you are in a checkout, run `git config --get ovnfs.checkout`
  inside it (it prints the name; the folder's repository never gets this key),
  or check `$OVNFS_CHECKOUT` under `ovnfs run`.
- In a folder other agents share (the user's main checkout), don't run git
  commands that discard work or move HEAD: `stash`, `reset --hard`,
  `switch`/`checkout BRANCH`, or `restore`/`checkout -- PATHS`. Do that in a
  checkout of your own, where it affects only you.

## Pitfalls

- ovnfs isolates files, not processes. It is not a sandbox: absolute paths
  and symlinks still reach the host.
- Run `ovnfs new` from the user's folder, not from inside the mount. In a
  checkout's root, `new` forks that checkout (with a warning). It refuses
  folders below a checkout's root and folders holding the mount, and refuses
  `--rev`, `--take` or `--rule` on a checkout.
- Keep the daemon's state directory on the same volume as your repositories.
  Otherwise `new` warns, and files are copied instead of cloned.
- On macOS (NFSv3), changes to `cache`/`local` paths in the folder can take up
  to 60 s to appear in the checkout.
- Linux needs `fusermount3` (package `fuse3`). Windows uses SMB or WinFsp, and
  the mount must be a free drive letter.
